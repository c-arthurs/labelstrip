### WARNING

This should work well on scripts that have a slide image. It has been reported that if the WSI was created without a label image then the script may corrupt the file.

Therefore please only use this on files that have been backed up. 

### Acknowledgement 

This script is built around the amazing [anonymize-slide](https://github.com/bgilbert/anonymize-slide). Their script was updated to python three to install it into this GUI.
